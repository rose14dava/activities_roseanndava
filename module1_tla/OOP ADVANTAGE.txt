Question:  How the OOP works in arrays, table, string and files manipulation?
 Answer:

OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, 
it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.

 OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere.
 
 OOPs provides the ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of
 real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.
